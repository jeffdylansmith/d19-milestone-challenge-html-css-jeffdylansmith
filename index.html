			<p>		I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in video production with a minor in film   studies. During my studies I have been involved in all manner of video production from producing single camera short films to working as an engineer on live, multi camera events. Along with my leadership and organizational skills I have acquired during my years in the transportation industry, I offer not only the technical skills to achieve the look you want but the creativity to help set you stand apart. </p>
